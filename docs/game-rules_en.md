### Introduction: 
Blackjack is a casino banking game. It is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as "**Twenty-one**". This game is a comparing card game where players aim to beat the dealer with a hand that most closely totals 21 points.

### Basics:
The goal of the game is to get a higher hand than the dealer without going over **21**. 
Going over 21 is called *busting*.
If a player has a better hand than the dealer without busting, they win their bet. 
If they have a worse hand, the dealer takes their bet.
Players determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards.

### Points Calculation: 
2 through 10: The number listed on the card *(e.g., 2 is worth 2 points)*
Jack, Queen, King: 10 points
Ace: 1 or 11 points (the player gets to choose)
An Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen, or King equals 21 points and is known as a **Blackjack**

### Rules of the Game:

- **Players have to make a bet with their chips:**
Using whatever betting materials they have on hand, each player wagers a certain amount of currency (before they even get their cards). All players must submit their bets before the round officially starts.

- **The dealer gives a card to each player as well as themselves:**
The dealer hands a card face-up to each player and then places a card face-down in front of themselves. It’s okay if the players can see each others’ hands—all that matters is that they can’t see the dealer’s first card. While distributing the second card the dealer places their card face-up in front of themselves.

- **The player to the left of the dealer starts gameplay:**
The gameplay continues in a clockwise direction so to keep things organized, have the player left of the dealer go first each round.
Each player should be given time to look over their cards and let the dealer know if they’d like to hit or stay. 

- **Decide whether to stay or hit:**
Look at the 2 cards and add the numerical total together, how close is it to 21, and how does it compare to the dealer’s hand? If the total is pretty high (like 17 or 18, which is very close to 21), “*staying*” (leaving it as-is) is probably the best option;
if the total is on the low end (like in the single digits), “*hitting*” or getting another card added, could be beneficial.

    Staying simply means that the dealer wont give another card that’ll get added to the total. 
    Hitting means that the dealer will add another card to the hand, until the hand reaches or goes over 21 one can hit as many times as they like.


- **The dealer reveals their second card and winners are determined:**
Once the players have revealed and submitted their action, the dealer reveals the original card to confirm their hand total. If the total is 16 or lower, they’re required to hit and take another card. If the card is 17 or higher, the dealer is required to stay.
	Push-In:
	    If the dealer gets a Blackjack, all the players automatically lose the round, unless they have a Blackjack themselves. In this case, the player who got Blackjack simply gets their original bet back. 
		Important: A push also occurs anytime the player’s hand matches the dealer’s.


- **Winnings are paid out and a new round begins:**
Any player with a hand that’s higher than the dealer’s (but not higher than 21) wins the round (unless they busted). All winning hand gets paid in a 1 to 1 ratio. If someone has a 21-point (Blackjack) hand, they typically get paid out at a 3 to 2 ratio.


### Special Game Mechanics

**Splitting**: 
If the second card is identical to the first *(e.g., two 8 cards)*, the player has the option to “split" their hand into 2 separate ones. The player has to place the same number of chips down for the split bet, and then ask for the dealer to “hit” each of their hands. Splitting can be considered as an extra turn for the round—each hand is separate from the other. Even if one hand busts, the player can continue playing with other hand.

- If the player split 2 Aces, they can only hit each hand one time. If they end up getting a point total of 21 on one of their hands, this isn’t considered a Blackjack, but it still *pushes* if the dealer gets a Blackjack.

**Doubling down**: 
The player has the option to “**double down**”, or double their initial bet before the dealer gives player another card—this gives player the chance to earn significantly more money in a single go. Doubling down only lets the player hit once. The player can double down on Split hands but they can't hit once they have doubled down.
